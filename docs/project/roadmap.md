## Remaining — Prioritized

### Tier 1: High Impact, Next Up

| # | Feature | Effort | Why |
|---|---------|--------|-----|
| 1 | **Tileset/Metatile Composer** | Large | Define 16x16 metatiles from 4 8x8 tiles with palette/flip per sub-tile. Enables truly custom tilesets. |
| 2 | **New Room Creation** | Medium | Allocate room header in $8F, door table, level data, enemy/PLM/scroll pointers. Auto-repointing foundation already exists. |
| 3 | **Room JSON Import** | Small | Export done; import creates RoomEdits from JSON file. Current: tiles + scrolls only (no enemies/PLMs/doors). |
| 4 | **AreaSave Expansion / Conflict UI** | Small-Medium | Save station spawn editing writes existing slots; table expansion and collision resolution remain. |
| 5 | **SMART XML Interop** | Medium | Export rooms in SMART XML format. Plugs into Map Randomizer ecosystem — no other modern editor has this. |

### Tier 2: Medium Impact

| # | Feature | Effort | Why |
|---|---------|--------|-----|
| 6 | **ROM Expansion** | Medium | Extend beyond 3MB (HiROM) to eliminate free space constraints. |
| 7 | **Palette Blending / FX Tint** | Medium | SNES color math register editing for transparency/blending effects. |
| 8 | **Layer 2/BG Scrolling Hardening** | Medium | Embedded L2 editing exists; still need richer parallax mode, BG pointer, and door-dependent transfer workflows. |
| 9 | **Validation Suite** | Medium | PLM index scanner, door validator, item bitflag checker, GFX limit warnings. |
| 10 | **Auto Item/Door ID Assignment** | Small | Scan all rooms, deduplicate collection bits, sequential ID assignment. |
| 11 | **Room Graph Discovery** | Small | Trace door connections from save stations, find orphaned/disconnected rooms. |

### Tier 3: Backlog

| # | Feature | Effort | Why |
|---|---------|--------|-----|
| 12 | **Projectile Editor** | Medium | Edit projectile behaviors, damage values, graphics. |
| 13 | **Block Grouping (2x1, 1x2, 2x2)** | Small | Grouped destructible blocks that break together with respawn toggles. |
| 14 | **Hotkey Configuration** | Small | Custom keyboard shortcut mapping. |
| 15 | **Samus Pose/Animation Editor** | Large | Configure animation poses per equipment state. |
| 16 | **Color Math Editor** | Medium | SNES Add/Subtract color math registers. |
| 17 | **Room Creation/Deletion** | Medium | Blank rooms with auto-assigned IDs, copy/paste between areas. |
| 18 | **Plugin System** | Large | Extensibility framework for custom tool integration. |

## Shelved / Deferred

- **Instant Respawn on Death** — Multiple patch attempts freeze after death animation. Needs deeper investigation.
- **Death Counter** — SRAM persistence for tracking deaths. Low priority.
- **Kill Count Editor** — Enemy kill count byte exposure. Low priority.
